# Back-to-Top-bookmarklet
A browser bookmark to click in order to go back to the top of the website.

A few websites have this idea in action on their sites.  I love it because there are so many sites that allow you to scroll so far down and the typical way back up to a nav bar or menu is to scroll or grab the scroll bar.  When this code is entered as a bookmark just clicking it once will send you back to the top of the page.

I wanted to try this solution on my own so I could create a solution to a problem I faced all the while learning more about javascript since I'm relatively new to javascript.  I'll learn more as I refactor and improve the code.

Directions:
1. Copy code and reduce into one line.
2. Create a new bookmark with a broswer.
3. Paste the code in for the URL.
